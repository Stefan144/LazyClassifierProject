# LazyClassifierProject

Files overview:

- "Report_Nikolic.pdf" - report on the project.

- "LazyClassifier.ipynb" - three lazy classification algorithms and their evaluation. Note, that I firstly executed all cells for "gini\_split\_data" and then for "quantile\_split\_data". Otherwise there might be a mistake since train/test split is named the same for both.

- "BaselineAlgorithms.ipynb" - SVM, Naive Bayes and Logistic regression evaluated.

- "Dataset\_Preprocessing.ipynb" - splitting the dataset into "quantile\_split\_data" and "gini\_split\_data" depending on the strategy of numerical feature binarization.

- "weatherAUS.csv" - original dataset.

- "quantile\_split\_data", "gini\_split\_data" - preprocessed datasets.
